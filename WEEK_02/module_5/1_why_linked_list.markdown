## When to Choose Linked Lists vs Arrays

| Operation          | Array     | Singly Linked List | Doubly Linked List |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Insert at Head     | O(N)      | ✅ O(1)            | ✅ O(1)            |
| Insert at Tail     | ✅ O(1)*  | ✅ O(1)            | ✅ O(1)            |
| Insert at Position   | O(N)      | O(N)               | O(N)               |
| Delete Head        | O(N)      | ✅ O(1)            | ✅ O(1)            |
| Delete Tail        | ✅ O(1)   | O(N)               | ✅ O(1)            |
| Delete at Position      | O(N)      | O(N)               | O(N)               |
| Random Access      | ✅ O(1)   | O(N)               | O(N)               |

## 🔍 Critical Considerations

Arrays are more memory-efficient since they store elements contiguously without extra pointers, while linked lists require additional memory for node links (`next`/`prev` references). This becomes significant with large datasets. In terms of cache performance, arrays have a clear advantage—their contiguous layout leverages spatial locality, minimizing cache misses during sequential access. Linked lists, with nodes potentially scattered in memory, often trigger more cache misses, hurting performance in traversal-heavy operations.

For middle operations, the table shows **O(N)** complexity for both, but there’s a nuance: linked lists can achieve **O(1)** insertion/deletion if you already hold a reference to the target node (e.g., via an iterator).

## 🌟 Best Use Cases

### Linked Lists Excel In:
- Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) implementations
- Scenarios with frequent head/tail modifications (e.g., undo/redo chains)
- Dynamic datasets where size fluctuates unpredictably

### Arrays / ArrayLists Are Preferable For:
- Random-access workloads (binary search, indexing)
- Memory-sensitive applications (e.g., embedded systems)
- Batch processing of data (matrix operations, buffering)
