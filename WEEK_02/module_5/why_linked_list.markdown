## Why Linked List

Linked lists come because of array's limitations.

An array stores data in sequential memory locations, allowing access to elements using indices.
It is memory efficient for storing contiguous data but cannot utilize non-sequential memory.


Why use linked lists instead of arrays?

- **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically, 
making them more flexible for applications where the number of elements is not known in advance.

- Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is efficient,
especially at the beginning or in the middle, as it requires only updating pointers, unlike arrays 
which may require shifting elements.

- Better Memory Utilization: Linked lists can utilize scattered memory locations, avoiding issues 
with memory fragmentation.
