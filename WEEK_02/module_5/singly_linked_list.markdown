## Types of Linked Lists:

1. **Singly Linked List**:
   - Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.
   - Efficient for traversing in ONE DIRECTION.
   - Insertion and deletion are straightforward but only in one direction.

2. **Doubly Linked List**:
   - Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to 
   the previous node.
   - Allows traversal in both directions (FORWARD and BACKWARD).
   - More complex to implement due to the additional pointer, but provides 
   more flexibility.

3. **Circular Linked List**:
   - Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points back to the 
   first node.
   - Can be singly or doubly linked.
   - Useful for applications requiring a circular structure, like round-robin 
   scheduling.

4. **Circular Doubly Linked List**:
   - Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to 
   the previous node, forming a circular structure.
   - Allows traversal in both directions and the list can be traversed 
   starting from any node.
   - Useful for complex data structures needing circular traversal.

Linked lists offer various types suited for different use cases, providing 
flexibility and efficient memory utilization for dynamic data structures.
