### What is up-heapify?

Up-heapify is the process of moving a newly inserted element up the heap to restore the heap property by comparing and swapping with its parent if necessary. The up-heapify process applies to both **max-heaps and min-heaps**.

### Four steps:
1. Insert the element
2. Compare with parent(like max heap or min heap)
3. swap if necessary
4. repeat

### Bonous: 

insert -> up-heapify
delete -> down-heapify
