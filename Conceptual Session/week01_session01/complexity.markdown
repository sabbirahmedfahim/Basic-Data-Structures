# What is Complexity?

Complexity is a process through which we can compare various programs and choose the best one. It means identifying which program needs less time and delivers the highest output.

**Time Complexity** : The amount of time taken by an *algorithm* to run, relative to the input size.

Types of complexity:
1. Contant time complexity
2. O(N), O(NlogN), O(√N), O(logN), O(N²) 

### Anyway, what is Order Of N? who's order? what order?

It is called Asymtotic Notation, and we calculate complexity using it. 

## There are three kinds of notations

1. Theta Notation (Θ)
2. Omega Notation (Ω)
3. Big-O Notation (O)
