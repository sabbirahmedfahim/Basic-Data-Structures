# What is Complexity?

It is a process who's through we can judge various programs and choose the best one. Means, which programme needs less time and give highest output. 

**Time Complexity** : The amount of time taken by an *algorithm* to run, relative to the input size.

Types of complexity:
1. Contant time complexity
2. O(N), O(NlogN), O(√N), O(logN), O(N²) 

### Anyway, what is Order Of N? who's order? what order?

It is called Asymtotic Notation, we calculate complexity using it. 

## There are three kinds of notations

1. Theta Notation (Θ)
2. Omega Notation (Ω)
3. Big-O Notation (O)
