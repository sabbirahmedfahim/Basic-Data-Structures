## What is heap:
A heap is an array representation of a complete binary tree.

It's a data structure where you're given an array, and you should assume it's a complete binary tree.

**It's not necessarily the case that the left subtree is smaller than the right subtree; rather, itâ€™s about the node's left and right children. In a max heap, the node's left and right children will be smaller than the node, whereas in a min heap, they will be greater than the node.**
