## What is Queue or Line?

A queue is a serial/line. The concept is simple-straightforward-- the last value will be stand in the last. 

For example, a ticket counter, if you are at the head of the line, you'll get the ticket first, then the second person who's position(not index :) is two. Then three, four and so on until the last person get the ticket who was at the last position in the ticket counter to get a ticket. Think of another example, doctors appoinment system.

Unlike Stack, Queue is not a pure data structure, its a system. If you understand stack, you'll understand queue.   

Simply queue is ->

First In, First Out.
Last In, Last Out.

Time complexity of **inserting at head/zero index**:
1. Singly Linked List O(1) ✓ (Memory Efficient)
2. Doubly Linked List O(1) ✓
3. List (STL) O(1) ✓
4. Dynamic Array O(N) ✗
